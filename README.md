# Getting Started with Python

Here I curate the online resources and provide the best way to get started with Python development. Note that, this are only resources to get started, but you have put in your effort to explore, practice and learn. Practice each concept with different examples. I also try to provide an overview of the technologies/frameworks based on python.

Let's look at Python evolution and importance to start with, (IT'S OKAY TO SPEND SOMETIME ON READING)
- [The evolution of Python programming](https://fadmagazine.com/2020/07/06/the-evolution-of-python-programming/)

Now let's look at Applications of Python. There are several applications of Python because it is open-source, community driven and had built a huge community in the last decade. I will mention top 10 applications below:
- Web Development (Django, Flask, Plotly Dash, FastAPI)
- Game Development (Pygame, PyKyra, Kivy, Pyglet)
- Machine Learning and AI (Scikit-learn, Tensorflow, PyTorch)
- Data Analysis and Visualization (Pandas, Dask, Pandas-Profiling, DataPrep)
- Desktop GUIs (PyQt5, Tkinter, Kivy, )
- Web Scraping applications (BeautifulSoup, Selenium, LXML)
- Embedded (IoT) Applications (Paho-MQTT, Sockets, Requests)
- Audio and Video Applications (OpenCV, pyAudioAnalysis, MoviePy)
- CAD Applications (Like Blender, FreeCAD)
- Business Applications (Odoo, Tryton)

NOTE: All these applications are built and developed using Frameworks / Packages written in core python programming languages.
